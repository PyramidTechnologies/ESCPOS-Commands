Official Reliance Thermal Printer ESC/POS Command Set Documentation

## Setup

It is recommended that you create a virtual environment for this project. Conda or venv are fine. Once configured, activate your environment before
proceeding.

For quick development, we recommend VS Code + https://github.com/vscode-restructuredtext/vscode-restructuredtext to edit and preview the docs
locally. Be sure to launch `code .` from your activate Python environment
for the VS Code plugin to work properly. Alternatively `make html`, you can manually build and view in your browser.

## Building

    pip install docutils
    pip install sphinx_rtd_theme
    pip install sphinx==1.2.2
    pip install sphinx-autobuild

(Can't use requirements.txt as that will break the build server for some reason)
